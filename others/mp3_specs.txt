create own auth module
	tips:
	use hashlib module built-in
	use try:except as control mechanism inside classes
	class Exceptions bespoke - not really to implement


	flow:
		1.) start w/ auth relevant classes
		2.) per class, identify the exceptions

	draft:
		class User:

		class Login_Mgr:

		class Permission_Mgt:

	constraints:
		password less than 6 characters
		cannot register if already exists (in username)
		map users and permissions together

	errors to handle:
		username already exists
		password less than 6 characters (invalid password)
		username does not exist
		error if di nakalogin
		error if not authorized in a certain permission
	
		tip:
			Make a specific exception that inherits from Exception
			then make specific exceptions from this exception (if username needed)

			Get Exception if username not needed
